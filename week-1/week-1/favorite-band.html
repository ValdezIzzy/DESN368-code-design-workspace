<p> Slipknot is an American heavy metal band formed in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1995. Known for their aggressive sound, chaotic live shows, and nine-member lineup wearing matching jumpsuits and iconic masks, they quickly became one of the most influential bands in modern metal. Their music blends elements of nu-metal, death metal, and industrial, featuring fast-paced drumming, distorted guitars, and intense vocals. Slipknot rose to fame with their self-titled debut album in 1999 and have since built a reputation for pushing boundaries both musically and visually, while cultivating a passionate global fanbase known as “Maggots.” For more info, visit

## Week 1 - Introduction to the Internet and the Web

**Topics Covered:**
- What is the Internet vs. the World Wide Web
- How browsers work
- Understanding IP addresses, DNS, and URLs
- History of the web

**Key Takeaways:**
Prior to the research and readings about the Internet, I had no idea what it truly is or how it works. I discovered many things about the creation of the web, broswers, IP addresses, and so much more. The most interesting take away to me is how everything is connected through actual cables that stretch across oceans to connect everything.

## Week 2 - Document Structure

**Topics Covered:**
- Learned how to properly structure HTML
- Learned multiple HTML tags

- HTML document hierarchy (parent-chid)

**Key Takeaways:**

**Projects/Exercises:**

## Week 3 - Start of Cascade

**Topics Covered:**
- Add CSS to HTML elements
- Link the CSS page to the HTML page
- Learn the different ways to style using CSS (sizing, colors, fonts, ect.,)

**Key Takeaways:**
Learned how to use CSS. There are a lot of takeaways because there was a lot of information during this period - learning how to select particular elements and change them and learn how to utilize class and id from HTML to change things that were coupled with other things and not change everything.

**Projects/Exercises:**
- Separated sections by changing background color
- Realigned text
- Changing font sizes
- Fixing the look of things without changing the HTML file
